## Usage

Press `CTRL + F10` to bring up the mod menu. Click on the Reset Visualizer mod,
and enable or disable the desired features.

### Features

#### Always Show

Always shows the bubbles

*This will disable the leaderboard by applying terminal damage when you
hit the finish line*

#### On Hit

This will only show the bubbles when you hit them

#### Distance-based hard resets

Disables the intersection checks for hard resets and instead implements a distance based check, similar to the way waypoints work.
The purpose of it is to demonstrate how much less frustrating something like this is to the player, and hopefully get it into
the main game into the future.

##### Compensation modes

*Restart to update compensation previews*

* None: uses the radius as-is
* Car: uses the car's width to approximate the width-feeling of the previous implementation
* Static: uses a user-defined custom value to add to the bubble

*for obvious reasons this disables the leaderboards*
